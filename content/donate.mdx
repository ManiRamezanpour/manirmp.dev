  Why donate?
</Heading>

Since 2015, I've crafted three open-source Android dashboards – [Blueprint](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/blueprint), [Frames](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/frames), and [Kuper](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/kuper) – empowering designers to create countless apps for the Play Store. I also share personal [projects](/projects) like other Android apps, websites, and more.
