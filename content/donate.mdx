<Heading $as={'h2'} className={'text-xl'}>Why donate?</Heading>

Since 2015, I've been making three open-source Android dashboards: [Blueprint](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/blueprint), [Frames](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/frames) and [Kuper](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/kuper).

They have helped countless designers create hundreds – if not thousands – of apps and publish them on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Jahir%20Fiquitiva&c=apps).

I also make some of my personal [projects](/projects) public, including Android apps, web apps, services, and bots.


<Heading $as={'h3'} className={'text-lg'}>Benefits</Heading>

Depending on the amount donated, you could earn one or some of the following:

- Get featured on this page
- Bug reports or feature requests prioritized
- A simple one-page static website
- Early and free access to future projects
- and [even more](https://github.com/sponsors/jahirfiquitiva/)…


<Heading $as={'h3'} className={'text-lg'}>Purpose</Heading>

What are the earnings going to be used for?

- Pay domain and platform services for different projects
- Allow me to buy courses to keep learning and growing my skillset
- Allow me to craft more open-source side projects
- Allow me to sponsor other people
- You name it (?)
