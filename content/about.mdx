<p className="text-sm text-primary-txt">I am Jahir Fiquitiva, a full-stack software engineer based in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´.</p>

I am creative and passionate about design and technology so I always try to craft great-looking software products.

Before getting into software development, I wanted to be a mechatronics engineer and build robots. When I started programming my first robots, I realized what my real passion was and started learning more about software development.

When not coding, I like to watch TV shows and movies, play some games with friends or hang out with them. I'm also listening to music most of the time.

I consider myself a curious and inquisitive person, so on my spare time I like to work on side projects, try to contribute to open source software and aim to constantly learn something new to improve my skillset.
